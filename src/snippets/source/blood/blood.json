However, this attack can be prevented by SID filtering.SID filtering removes domain SIDs from authentication requests of foreign principals based on the trust configuration. Built-in SIDs (S-1-5-32-*) are always filtered, regardless of the configuration. For cross-forest trusts, blocking spoof SID history attacks requires filtering out SIDs that do not belong to the forest of the trusted domain.Cross-forest trusts blocks spoof SID history attacks by default. Forest trusts filter out SIDs that do not belong to the forest of the trusted domain. However, SID filtering for forest trusts can be relaxed by enabling the trustAttributes flag TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL. When enabled, SID filtering behaves like it does for external trusts (without quarantine mode), meaning only SIDs with a RID below 1000 (built-in AD principals) are filtered, allowing a potential spoof SID history attack.External trusts have quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN) enabled by default, protecting the trusting domain by filtering out SIDs that do not belong to the trusted domain in authentication requests. An external trust with quarantine mode disabled does not block spoof SID history attacks.SID filtering is managed from the outbound side of the trust. As a result, this property is only created if trust data from the outbound side has been ingested.- TGT Delegation\nTGT delegation determines whether unconstrained delegation is allowed over the trust. When a principal from the trusted domain authenticates against a Kerberos resource with unconstrained delegation in the trusting domain, their Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is forwarded to the resource as part of Kerberos authentication, but only if TGT delegation is enabled (true).By default, TGT delegation is disabled for cross-forest trusts. It is enabled if the trustAttributes flag CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION is enabled for the trust and quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN) is NOT enabled.TGT delegation is controlled from the inbound side of the trust, and the property is therefore only created if trust data from this side has been ingested.- Transitive\nTransitivity defines whether the trust extends beyond the two domains involved. A transitive trust allows access not only to principals of the trusted domain but also to those from other domains trusted by the trusted domain.Forest trusts are always transitive, external trusts are non-transitive.Attackers can bypass the limitations of non-transitive trusts by manually requesting local Kerberos TGTs for each domain in the trust chain. They can then use these local TGTs to access Kerberos resources that would otherwise be denied if requested directly. For more details, refer to \"External trusts are evil\" under References.- Trust Attributes\nThis property stores the raw value of the trustAttributes LDAP attribute, which defines the trust's configuration settings. BloodHound retains this property from both the outbound and inbound sides of the trust, as they may differ.- Trust Type\nThe trust type for cross-forest trusts can be Forest, External, Kerberos (Realm), or Unknown.

Built-in SIDs (S-1-5-32-*) are always filtered, regardless of the configuration. SID filtering blocks the spoof SID history attack over same-forest trusts when the trust is configured in quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN enabled), which filters out SIDs that do not belong to the trusted domain. Same-forest trusts does not have quarantine mode enabled by default.SID filtering is managed from the outbound side of the trust, and the \"Spoof SID History Blocked\" property is therefore only created if trust data from this side has been ingested.- TGT Delegation\nTGT delegation determines whether unconstrained delegation is allowed over the trust. When a principal from the trusted domain authenticates against a Kerberos resource with unconstrained delegation in the trusting domain, their Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is forwarded to the resource as part of Kerberos authentication, but only if TGT delegation is enabled (true).By default, TGT delegation is enabled for same-forest trusts. It is disabled if quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN) is enabled.TGT delegation is controlled from the inbound side of the trust, and the property is therefore only created if trust data from this side has been ingested.- Transitive\nTransitivity defines whether the trust extends beyond the two domains involved. A transitive trust allows access not only to principals of the trusted domain but also to those from other domains trusted by the trusted domain.\n\nSame-forest trusts are always transitive.- Trust Attributes\nThis property stores the raw value of the trustAttributes LDAP attribute, which defines the trust's configuration settings. BloodHound retains this property from both the outbound and inbound sides of the trust, as they may differ.- Trust Type\nThe trust type for same-forest trusts can be TreeRoot, ParentChild, or CrossLink (Shortcut).
