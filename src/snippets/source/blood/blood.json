As a result, the SQL Server service account can be used to log into the SQL Server instance remotely, read all of the databases (including those protected with transparent encryption), and run operating systems command through SQL Server (as the service account) using a variety of techniques.For Windows systems that have been joined to an Active Directory domain, the SQL Server instances and the associated service account can be identified by executing a LDAP query for a list of \"MSSQLSvc\" Service Principal Names (SPN) as a domain user.

In this relationship, the controlled object domain has a cross-forest trust to the target object domain, allowing principals (users and computers) from target object to access resources in controlled object. \n**Trust Edge Properties**\n BloodHound stores the following properties for CrossForestTrust edges (listed under Relationship Information):- Spoof SID History Blocked\nAn attacker with control over the trusted domain may attempt to escalate privileges in the trusting domain using a spoof SID history attack by injecting the SID of a privileged principal from the trusting domain into their authentication request. However, this attack can be prevented by SID filtering.SID filtering removes domain SIDs from authentication requests of foreign principals based on the trust configuration. Built-in SIDs (S-1-5-32-*) are always filtered, regardless of the configuration. For cross-forest trusts, blocking spoof SID history attacks requires filtering out SIDs that do not belong to the forest of the trusted domain.Cross-forest trusts blocks spoof SID history attacks by default. Forest trusts filter out SIDs that do not belong to the forest of the trusted domain. However, SID filtering for forest trusts can be relaxed by enabling the trustAttributes flag TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL. When enabled, SID filtering behaves like it does for external trusts (without quarantine mode), meaning only SIDs with a RID below 1000 (built-in AD principals) are filtered, allowing a potential spoof SID history attack.External trusts have quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN) enabled by default, protecting the trusting domain by filtering out SIDs that do not belong to the trusted domain in authentication requests. An external trust with quarantine mode disabled does not block spoof SID history attacks.SID filtering is managed from the outbound side of the trust. As a result, this property is only created if trust data from the outbound side has been ingested.- TGT Delegation\nTGT delegation determines whether unconstrained delegation is allowed over the trust. When a principal from the trusted domain authenticates against a Kerberos resource with unconstrained delegation in the trusting domain, their Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is forwarded to the resource as part of Kerberos authentication, but only if TGT delegation is enabled (true).By default, TGT delegation is disabled for cross-forest trusts. It is enabled if the trustAttributes flag CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ENABLE_TGT_DELEGATION is enabled for the trust and quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN) is NOT enabled.TGT delegation is controlled from the inbound side of the trust, and the property is therefore only created if trust data from this side has been ingested.- Transitive\nTransitivity defines whether the trust extends beyond the two domains involved. A transitive trust allows access not only to principals of the trusted domain but also to those from other domains trusted by the trusted domain.Forest trusts are always transitive, external trusts are non-transitive.Attackers can bypass the limitations of non-transitive trusts by manually requesting local Kerberos TGTs for each domain in the trust chain. They can then use these local TGTs to access Kerberos resources that would otherwise be denied if requested directly. For more details, refer to \"External trusts are evil\" under References.- Trust Attributes\nThis property stores the raw value of the trustAttributes LDAP attribute, which defines the trust's configuration settings. BloodHound retains this property from both the outbound and inbound sides of the trust, as they may differ.- Trust Type\nThe trust type for cross-forest trusts can be Forest, External, Kerberos (Realm), or Unknown.

It also means compromising one of the domains enable compromise of the other. \n**Trust Edge Properties**\n BloodHound stores the following properties for SameForestTrust edges (listed under Relationship Information):- Spoof SID History Blocked\nAn attacker with control over the trusted domain may attempt to escalate privileges in the trusting domain using a spoof SID history attack by injecting the SID of a privileged principal from the trusting domain into their authentication request. However, this attack can be prevented by SID filtering.SID filtering removes domain SIDs from authentication requests of foreign principals based on the trust configuration. Built-in SIDs (S-1-5-32-*) are always filtered, regardless of the configuration. SID filtering blocks the spoof SID history attack over same-forest trusts when the trust is configured in quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN enabled), which filters out SIDs that do not belong to the trusted domain. Same-forest trusts does not have quarantine mode enabled by default.SID filtering is managed from the outbound side of the trust, and the \"Spoof SID History Blocked\" property is therefore only created if trust data from this side has been ingested.- TGT Delegation\nTGT delegation determines whether unconstrained delegation is allowed over the trust. When a principal from the trusted domain authenticates against a Kerberos resource with unconstrained delegation in the trusting domain, their Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is forwarded to the resource as part of Kerberos authentication, but only if TGT delegation is enabled (true).By default, TGT delegation is enabled for same-forest trusts. It is disabled if quarantine mode (trustAttributes flag QUARANTINED_DOMAIN) is enabled.TGT delegation is controlled from the inbound side of the trust, and the property is therefore only created if trust data from this side has been ingested.- Transitive\nTransitivity defines whether the trust extends beyond the two domains involved. A transitive trust allows access not only to principals of the trusted domain but also to those from other domains trusted by the trusted domain.\n\nSame-forest trusts are always transitive.- Trust Attributes\nThis property stores the raw value of the trustAttributes LDAP attribute, which defines the trust's configuration settings. BloodHound retains this property from both the outbound and inbound sides of the trust, as they may differ.- Trust Type\nThe trust type for same-forest trusts can be TreeRoot, ParentChild, or CrossLink (Shortcut).

The victim also has enrollment permission for an enterprise CA with the necessary templates published. This enterprise CA is trusted for NT authentication in the forest, and chains up to a root CA for the forest. There is an affected Domain Controller (DC) configured to allow weak certificate binding enforcement. This setup lets the principal impersonate any AD forest principal (user or computer) without their credentials.The attacker principal can abuse their control over the victim principal to modify the victim’s UPN to match the sAMAccountName of a targeted principal. Example: If the targeted principal is Administrator@corp.local user, the victim's UPN will be populated with \"Administrator\" (without the @corp.local ending). The attacker principal will then abuse their control over the victim principal to obtain the credentials of the victim principal, or a session as the victim principal, and enroll a certificate as the victim in one of the affected certificate templates. The UPN of the victim (\"Administrator\") will be included in the issued certificate under the SAN. As the certificate template does not have the security extension, it will NOT include the SID of the victim user in the issued certificate. Next, the attacker principal will again set the UPN of the victim, this time to an arbitrary string (e.g. the original value). The issued certificate can now be used for authentication against an affected DC. The weak certificate binding configuration on the DC will make the DC accept that the SID of the victim user is not present in the issued certificate when performing Kerberos authentication, and it will use the SAN value to map the certificate to a principal. The DC will attempt to find a principal with a UPN matching the SAN value (“Administrator”) but as the victim’s UPN has been changed after the enrollment, there will be no principals with this UPN. The DC will then attempt to find a principal with a sAMAccountName matching the SAN value and find the targeted user. At last, the DC issues a Kerberos TGT as the targeted user to the attacker, which means the attacker now has a session as the targeted user. In case the target is a computer, the DC will find it as well as the DC will attempt sAMAccountName matching with a $ at the end of the SAN value as last resort.",
