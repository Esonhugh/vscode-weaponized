        "meaning": "The Enterprise Certification Authority node is the enrollment service LDAP object for CA hosted on the computer node. An attacker may perform several attacks that rely on this relationship. This relationship alone is not enough to escalate rights or impersonate other principals. The enterprise CA must chain up to a root CA of the AD forest and it must be trusted for NT authentication in the AD forest for an escalation to be possible.",
        "common": "不可直接利用 - 此关系本身不足以提升权限或冒充其他主体，需要企业 CA 链接到 AD 林的根 CA 并且被信任用于 NT 身份验证才能进行权限提升，如满足条件会生成 GoldenCert 攻击边"
